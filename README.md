# Algorithms & Advanced Algorithms Assingments

This repository contains code files as well as PDF Reports for the 4 Analytical and 4 Programming Assingments of the ECE NTUA Course "Algorithms and Complexity", offered at 2018, as well as for the 3 Analytical Assingments of the ECE NTUA Course "Advanced Algorithms", offered at 2019.

Assingments cover most of the classical algorithmic areas as well as modern approaches, like: Data Structures and Trees, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Linear Programming, Approximation Algorithms and Randomized Algorithms. Assingments received competitve grades.
