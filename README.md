# Algorithmic Assingments

This repository contains code files and PDF Reports for:
* 3 Analytical Assingments of the ECE NTUA Course "Discrete Mathematics", 2017
* 4 Analytical and 4 Programming Assingments of the ECE NTUA Course "Algorithms and Complexity", 2018
* 3 Analytical Assingments of the ECE NTUA Course "Advanced Algorithms", offered at 2019.

Assingments cover most of the classical algorithmic areas as well as modern approaches, like: Data Structures, Graph Theory and Trees, Logic, Combinatorics, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Linear Programming, Approximation Algorithms and Randomized Algorithms. Assingments received competitve grades.
